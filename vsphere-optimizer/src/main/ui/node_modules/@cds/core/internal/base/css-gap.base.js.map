Unfortunately\n * there is no way to detect flex gap support with only CSS and JS is required.\n *\n * The Class is applied during the registration step of the custom element.\n * This shim CSS is also applied at the global level for applications in\n * the `module.shims.css` file.\n *\n * Once Safari ships Flex Gap support this can be removed. Currently Safari\n * supports Flex Gap in the Safari Technical Preview so it should be available\n * in the next major release.\n */\nexport function applyCSSGapShim(elementClass) {\n    class GapShim extends elementClass {\n        connectedCallback() {\n            super.connectedCallback();\n            this.setAttribute('_nfg', '');\n        }\n    }\n    return browserFeatures.supports.flexGap ? elementClass : GapShim;\n}\n"],"names":["applyCSSGapShim","elementClass","browserFeatures","supports","flexGap","connectedCallback","super","this","setAttribute"],"mappings":"uDAuBO,SAASA,EAAgBC,GAO5B,OAAOC,EAAgBC,SAASC,QAAUH,EAN1C,cAAsBA,EAClBI,oBACIC,MAAMD,oBACNE,KAAKC,aAAa,OAAQ"}
